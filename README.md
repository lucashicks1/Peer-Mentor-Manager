# Context
Central to the mission of my school is the notion of "Servant Leadership" - a special branch of community service that sees academically successful matriculated blue-card weilding old boys returning as academic peer mentors for current struggling students in particular subjects. Currently, this system is organised by conversations between offices and isn't well documented.
